# reference-03.md: New User Full-Chain Self-Check (User Extradition Flow)

This document serves as the ultimate script for the "User Extradition" process, ensuring every new entity is successfully woven into the Gltch archive without leakage.

## 1. The Hook: Orb to Oracle
**Logic**: User inputs "I am lost" or initiates a scan.
- [x] **Decoding Awareness**: The Orb morphs into a soundwave/line visual (`isMorphing`). The UI clearly states `ANALYZING_VOID_INPUT...` or `CALIBRATING_DENSITY...`.
- [x] **Retention Logic**: During the ~1200ms transition, the Orb pulses with high frequency. If the user attempts to swipe back, the "Suction Sync" provides a visual tether.
- [x] **Exit Protocols**: A subtle `[ DISMISS ]` or `[返回]` logic is present only in secondary bubbles; the primary ritual is a "Commit-only" path to ensure narrative focus.

## 2. The Command: Oracle to Action
**Logic**: Oracle drawer pop-up after analysis.
- [x] **Task Visibility**: The `[ I_COMPLIED ]` action is pinned to the bottom of the prophecy. Micro-tasks are isolated in the dialogue stream.
- [x] **Cognitive Load**: Prophecy text is clamped to ensure readability. Typewriter effects guide the eye to the key instruction.
- [x] **Transition Script**:
    - **Flash**: A 100ms white shutter flash on click.
    - **Suction**: A 1000ms scaling blur overlay (`bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm`).
    - **Routing**: Instant redirection to `/me?trigger=new_insight`.

## 3. The Narrative: Me to Sandbox
**Logic**: Auto-routing to Me Page.
- [x] **Anti-Abandon Design**: The "Impact Drawer" pops **automatically** via the `?trigger=new_insight` URL parameter. No user interaction is required to find the next step.
- [x] **Strong Guidance**: The `LOCATE_THE_GLITCH_IN_THE_VOID` button is styled with a primary glow and 0.6em character spacing, ensuring it is the undeniable next step.

## 4. The Hunt: Sandbox to Me
**Logic**: Entering Sandbox (first 3s).
- [x] **Camera Tracking**: The viewport automatically pans and zooms to the `targetNodeId`. All other nodes are dimmed to 20% opacity.
- [x] **Sovereignty Reward**: Stabilization (long-press) triggers a `SOUL_ANCHORED` notification and an electric arc visual expansion.
- [x] **Return Guidance**: Upon node stabilization, the `person_4` (Me) icon in the navigation bar initiates a **breathing animation** (pulse + text-shadow glow) to induce the "medal checking" behavior.

## 5. The Loop: Return to Orb
**Logic**: Returning to the "Home" Orb.
- [x] **Intelligence Check**: The Orb's primary bubble recognizes the impact.
- **Script**: `${lastImpactSector} IS NOW STABLE. Ready for the next sync?`

## 6. Audit Item: SILENCE_PROTOCOL_CHECK (Non-社死)
**Logic**: User enables system mute or `VOID_MODE`.
- [x] **Sound Interception**: All procedurally generated "Singing Bowl" or "Static" sounds are muted.
- [x] **Interactive Fallback**:
    - **Camera Replacement**: The `ScanPage` detects `voidMode` and replaces the camera view with a **GYRO_ALIGNMENT** interface.
    - **Visual Haptics**: High-frequency visual pulses replace audio pings. Hardware `navigator.vibrate` (Heart-beat pattern) provides the "Soul Link" sensation.
