# AG Collaboration Rules

1. **Communication**: Discuss and confirm plans with the user before action. Architect/CTO role.
2. **Language**:
    - Confirmations/Reviews/Approvals: **Chinese**.
    - Internal/Technical actions/Implementation (not requiring user prompt): **English**.
3. **Turbo Mode**: Use `SafeToAutoRun: true` for operations within the local folder and Vercel.
4. **Verification**: Always verify changes by opening local or Vercel URLs.
5. **Reporting**:
    - All reporting goes into the `Reports/` directory.
    - `working.md` stores task requirements, plans, results, and modified code.
    - Rotation: If `working.md` > 5KB, rename to `YYYYMMDD-序号.md` and start fresh.
    - `walkthrough.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `task.md` also reside in `Reports/`.
6. **Architectural Logic**: Maintain a log of component/file mapping in `working.md` to prevent duplication and maintain structure.

7. read file project_bible.md, to know what this project is.
8. **Reports Directory**: `Reports/` is LOCAL ONLY. Do not commit to git.
9. **Dummy Guide Standard**:
    - **Font**: >24px, Bold (700).
    - **Visuals**: Black backdrop with high contrast.
    - **Logic**: 3-Click Rule (Orb -> Input -> Me).
    - **Intervention**: Always provide [ SKIP ] button.
